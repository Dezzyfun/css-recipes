    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara (Italian: [karbo'na:ra]) is a pasta dish made with eggs, hard 
        cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish took its modern form and 
        name in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, parmesan, or a combination of the two.
     Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or 
     bucatini are also used. Normally guanciale or pancetta are used for the meat 
     component, but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.</p>
